Title: Phage Shift

What is the goal of the game?  What is the story or theme or
emotion?

-You play as a bacteriophage (the Phage) re-engineered for good.
 Your mission is to eliminate the virus that has spread throughout the mysterious being referred to simply
 as "the Host".  It is unknown exactly why you were created or who the host is at this point, but you are
 only driven by the need to purge the enemies... or disintegrate trying.

 The theme is energetic survival, with an underlyig mystery as to where you are.
 Stay alive and eliminate as much of the virus to see if there is an end to this journey.

Ideas on style and design.  What does the game world look like?

-The world as you know it cosists of sections of some organic being, with a minimalist and stylized design.
 Each floor that you encounter is different from the last, but there is no discernable pattern.  Walls block
 your path, hazards slow or harm you, and viruses lurk in growing numbers.

 Clear the floor to open a pathway down to the next level, until you reach the core.  Clear all floors to win,
 or leave a score if you don't make it.

How does the player control the game?  Is there a user interface?

-Control the Phage with WASD to move around the map.  Mouse over to aim and click to shoot.  
 Use QE to rotate the camera, P to pause, and ESC to quit.

 There is a title screen with a start and quit button and previous highscores listed.

 A pause screen is available with controls information.  A limited HUD shows the timer value
 and at least shows how to pause (ex: "P to pause").  If time runs out, you are overrun and lose.

What other elements are there (NPCs, collectibles, dangers)?

-In addition to the virus hovering around the playfield, some power-ups and environmental dangers will appear.
 Enemies will float around randomly and follow the player when in range.  Power-ups can be found around the
 field to increase firerate or damage.

 The playfield is obstructed by walls also, and some walls have spikes.  Beware!  Other cautions include high
 speed currents when there are no walls to control flow, this will make movement difficult but not impossible.
 The player must try not to fall off the edge.
