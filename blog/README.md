So far we've split up and are working on our individual pieces, pushing to git as we go.  We each have a test scene that we are working on, but contructing them primarily from prefabs so that a game manager script will handle the majority of the scene contruction in the end.

Hayden has a solid chaser AI for the virus with a nice navmesh, Derek has a neat walker algorithm for the Phage and a shooter basis, and Ben has made a preliminary playfield generator with some menus.

The game is at a pretty good starting point and is generally playable, now we just need to polish various features to make the game more appealing.  Moving forward, here is what we plan to focus on now:

Ben -- Add scoreboard logic and clean up various menu functionalities. Improve wall quality.

Derek -- Power ups.

Hayden -- Various animations.

After receiving some feedback from the discussion thread on canvas, we implemented a few changes that were suggested for general gameplay improvement.  Now, controls are a bit more intuitive and the scoreboard appears to be working.  HUD has also been improved to stand out more with better indications of what to do and health/cooldown statuses.

Aside from suggestions, we also implemented powerups added after level 1 and field resizing every 5 levels for a max field size 5x that of the start.

Additionally, we are working on destructable walls and general improvement of prefabs and animations.
